# Welcome

Let me introduce myself:
I am a local maker in Chepstow primarily using my 13 years of experience in technology (product design, graphics design, CAD) to create a wide range of things.
By profession I am a software developer, which is just another form of creating. :)

## Services

### Design
I have been working on design projects ranging from graphics, web and product design for over a decade.
Bring me your idea or request and I'll help you coming up with a plan, product development and ultimately the result.

### Materials
- Acrylic
- Plywood of any kind up to 5mm
- MDF
- Glass
- Mirror
- Cardboard
- Painted metal

## Prices
The pricing is calculated by the order. The reason is that it is based on the materials, running time and design.
Give me a call or send an email and I'll get back to you very quickly.
